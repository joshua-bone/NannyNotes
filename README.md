### Description
NannyNotes is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate communication and planning between parents and nannies. A user can sign in as either a parent or a nanny. A parent can create a new household, while a nanny can join a household by invite. Each household view will show the names and ages of the children as well as a calendar view that allows the parent to design a daily schedule for the nanny to implement. The nanny can then document alongside the schedule the actual events of the day.
